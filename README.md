It's a custom ESP32 devboard. It was designed to be a drone flight controller, but it's suitable for other projects as well.
I wanted to make this because I thought it was a good idea to try to design a drone with custom electronics. Turns out, electronics are hard, so I just made this.
It'll go on the drone when all the other parts are done. This project is being made for and funded by Hack Club's Highway program. 

This is my first circuit board by the way, hopefully I did a good job. I'm planning on designing my own brushless motor speed controller next, but I may just move on to the drone if that's too hard. 

## Features
- Integrated gyro and accelerometer (MPU-6050)
- Integrated magnetometer
- Voltage Regulator that drops drone battery voltage (14.8v) to 5v
- ESP32 Chip for processing, wifi, and bluetooth connectivity
- USB-C 2.0 port for programming and power supply
- Boot and Reset buttons
- A whole lotta GPIO pins
